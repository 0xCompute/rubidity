# use numeric for UInt, Int and such - why? why not?

# Numeric should be used when defining other numeric classes.
#
# Classes which inherit from Numeric must implement coerce, 
# which returns a two-member Array containing an object that has been coerced 
# into an instance of the new class and self (see coerce).
#
# Inheriting classes should also implement 
# arithmetic operator methods (+, -, * and /) and 
# the <=> operator (see Comparable). 
# These methods may rely on coerce to ensure interoperability
#  with instances of other numeric classes.
#
#  see https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.5.1/Numeric.html

## todo: try UInt2  without Number base
##    works the same??? - why? why not?
##  what's the benefit of derivation from Numeric???

# coerce(numeric) â†’ array
# If numeric is the same type as num, returns an array [numeric, num].
#  Otherwise, returns an array with both numeric and num represented as Float objects.
#
# This coercion mechanism is used by Ruby to handle mixed-type numeric operations:
#  it is intended to find a compatible common type between the two operands of the operator.
# 
# 1.coerce(2.5)   #=> [2.5, 1.0]
# 1.2.coerce(3)   #=> [3.0, 1.2]
# 1.coerce(2)     #=> [2, 1]
