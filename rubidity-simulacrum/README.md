# Soliscript (formerly known as Rubidity Simulacrum)


Note: Starting with version 0.1.2 the [rubidity-simulacrum gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubidity-simulacrum) 
is now known and published as the [soliscript gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/soliscript).

Q: Why?

A: Why not?  More serious - let's remove the hated ruby from the name for our solidity friends (to maybe give it a try). solidity programmers hate ruby. rubyist hate solidity. a perfect match! solidity <3 ruby . join us in spreading the ruby love (in blockchain contract programming) ;-).
