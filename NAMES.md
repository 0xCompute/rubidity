> I find your fork interesting and thought provoking! I like reading your posts. I just don't want people to be confused. There is no need to delete any past things or to stop doing any future things, I would just appreciate it if you would change the name to clearly distinguish the two projects.

## More Naming Madness

Summary

| Old Name                |  New Name   |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| rubidity (next)         | ⇒ rubysol   |
| rubidity classic / o.g  | ⇒ rubidity  |
| rubidity typed          | ⇒ solidity typed  |
| rubidity simulacrum     | ⇒ soliscript  |
| red paper contracts     | ⇒ soliscript starter contracts |



### Solidity Typed (formerly known as Rubidity Typed)

Note: The ~~rubyidity-typed gem~~ is now known and published as the [solidity-typed gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/solidity-typed).

Q: Why?

A: Why not?  More serious - the idea is to stress the fact of the 100% solidity-compatibility with types and application binary interfaces (abis)
and the "zero-dependency" to support easy (re)use in many solidity-inspired (blockchain) contract programming languages incl. rubidity, rubysol et al.   


For more see [**Solidity Typed »**](solidity-typed)



### Rubidity  (formerly known as Rubidity Classic)


Note: The ~~rubyidity-classic gem~~ is now known and published as the [rubidity gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubidity).

Q: Why?

A:  The gem formerly knows as rubidity (next) is now known and published
as rubysol and the "classic / o.g." becomes the one and only rubidity
to avoid any confusion about syntax and style when contract programming in ruby.


For more see [**Rubidity »**](rubidity)



### Soliscript (formerly known as Rubidity Simulacrum)


Note: The ~~rubidity-simulacrum gem~~ is now known and published as the [soliscript gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/soliscript).


Q: Why?

A: Why not?  More serious - let's remove the hated ruby from the name for our solidity friends (to maybe give it a try). solidity programmers hate ruby. rubyist hate solidity. a perfect match! solidity <3 ruby . join us in spreading the ruby love (in blockchain contract programming) ;-).

For more see [**Soliscript »**](https://github.com/soliscript/soliscript)



### Red Paper - Run (Blockchain) Contracts With Rubidity and Simulacrum!

Note: The red paper contracts are now 
part of the new [**soliscript quick starter project repo template**](https://github.com/soliscript/soliscript.starter).  
The first version incl. satoshi dice (gambling), crowd funder and ballot (liquid delegate democracy voting).
