Your Facet Card is your passport on the Facet Protocol. It's your username, profile, and chronicle of your achievements, all in one.

Reserve your name (and earn a STICKER) starting tomorrow (November 11th, 2023) 
at 8am EST!

What are Facet Cards?

Facet Cards are a highly-efficient alternative to ENS (Ethereum Name Service). 
Everything you can do with ENS you can do with Facet Cards, except Facet Cards use 10x less gas.

Facet Cards will serve as the name service for all official Facet decentralized apps. 
If you want your name to appear, consider reserving it!

Secondly, every Facet Card is accompanied by a Profile that can be accessed at https://fac.et/name. Your Facet Profile serves as a dynamic gallery showcasing your Facet assets, transactions, and even your STICKERS!

Did someone say stickers?

Stickers are proof of your achievements, affiliations, and accolades.

For example, everyone who reserves a name pre-launch will be entitled to claim an "Early Reserver" sticker. Add the sticker to your Card as cryptographic proof you were here from day one!

Stickers are not mere decorations; they are a platform. Anyone can create stickers and make them available for others to claim.

Stickers can serve various purposes, such as being POAPs, rewards, authentication tokens, and more!


Q: How to reserve your name?

A: Head to https://facet.cards at 8am EST tomorrow (November 11, 2023)!

Facet Cards are ERC-721 assets on the Facet Protocol. 
If you reserve a name you will be airdropped your Card when Facet launches this month.


Here are the name reservation prices, denominated in ETH:

- 1 character (0-9): $25,000 USD per year
- 1 character (a-z): $10,000 per year
- 2 characters: $1,000 per year
- 3 characters: $500 per year
- 4 characters: $100 per year
- 5 or more characters: $10 per year

Note: At Facet, we value and respect intellectual property rights. 
If you are the legitimate owner of a trademark and wish to ensure that no one squats your Facet Card, please reach out to us via email at hello@facet.org.

We believe identity will be one of Facet's killer apps.

What we have planned for Facet Cards would cost far too much gas for the EVM 
and is too important to live on a platform that can be shut off at any time, like an L2.

We can't wait for it to launch!

And that's it! Get ready to reserve your name tomorrow (November 11th, 2023) at 8am EST:

#### Q: Is the Facet card mainnet based erc-721 or facetscan based erc-721?
