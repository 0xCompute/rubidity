The first pdf inscription is no. 17123  (part of a collection / series 1 of 36).
see <https://github.com/s6ruby/rubidity/blob/master/programming-ethscriptions/pdfs/17123.pdf>

The title is "Ethereum: A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform" and only one page ;-).

I found 36 pdfs in sub100kand and all are part of the series above. 
one inscription = one page. page 1 to 36 of the ethereum whitepaper.
