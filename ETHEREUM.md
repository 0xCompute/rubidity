Notes on why layer (l1) rubidity with (dumb) contracts
is easier, cheaper, etc.

- cheaper! - by how much - 4x ?
- reuse, reuse, reuse - lets you reuse (builtin/standard) contracts!!!
- more secure - reuse of "builtin/standard" contracts (that can get upgraded with bux fixes!!!)
- upgradable - yes, no?  - state is separate from contract (code)!
- keeps the storage "off-chain"
- "off-chain" storage stored in sql tables (easy/easier to query)
- offers api for storage queries



make compute cheaper - no more "gas" counting for instructions
- only pay for storage / bytes (call data) with gas
  or for bridging calls and contract "proxy" creation ???
