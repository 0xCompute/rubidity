# Punks

The idea:

let's use the (bug fixed) cryptopunks v1 contract here -> https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.contracts/blob/master/punks-v1/CryptoPunks.sol   and yes, why not?  let's convert to a (dumb) contract and deploy on facet.   that may be  the world's 1st punk collection AND built-in market on facet! and yes, like the historic punks (anno 2017) - the "facet" punks (anno 2023)  are free to claim (only pay calldata / inscription gas transaction fees)  comments? questions? 

ps: to avoid trademark / copyright claims - let's change the image hash to a new 10 000 punk (or phunk) image / set. 


Comments:

we would have to change the image hash because all 10k Cryptopunks and cryptophunks have been inscribed onchain. These can't be duplicated. We can't use the originals and mint those and flipping them left won't work because CryptoPhunks are already fully etched online. 


More:

ha. that's the beauty of (dumb) contracts or the punk (dumb) contract.  the composite all-in-one image will be "off-chain".  thus, no worries about duplicates.  if you get a punk via the (dumb) contract than you get a token with an "on-chain" index (e.g. 0,1,2,3, etc.) like in the original (anno 2017)!  and every inscription is a (dumb) contract inscription (no image ever etched). back to the future! 

and yes, of course the idea is to generate a new 10 000 punks set anyway
that automagically has a new hash.  i have done many (new!) 10 000 punk series already.  a great candidate might be the human series with 10 skin tones (using the google skin tone research sponsored dr. ellis monk skin tones  - see https://skintone.google/ ) and the script to generate all 10 000 (human) punks (no aliens, zombies, apes) -> 
https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.sandbox/blob/master/humans/generate_10000.rb
  and here's an image preview of the first ones in 2x

)

or maybe using an ethscribe neon (ethscribe) green skin tone ;-) -> 
![](https://github.com/ordinalpunks/ordinalpunks.sandbox/raw/master/ethscribes/i/ethscribes@4x.png)

or maybe using a neon effect on a black & white sketch  - the (bitcon) orange preview here to be changed to green ;-) -> 
![](https://github.com/ordinalpunks/ordinalpunks.sandbox/raw/master/neon/i/neons.png)   anyways, for sure no 1:1 copy or a reshuffle or left-right flip. 



## Punk (Dumb) Contract

Todos

- [ ] change to rubidity / rubysol
- [ ] change image hash
- [ ] change known bug  - fix bug!
- [ ] change ether (eth) to bridged ether or erc-20 token?
- [ ] maybe make into (standard) erc-721 token  (no wrapper needed) - why? why not?



## Timeline

- [ ] This (minimum) requires struct support in Rubidity! Wen?
- [ ] This (dumb) contracts needs to get accepted to the curated (trusted) contract set for going live / deployment on mainnet. Wen? 



## More Ideas

- [ ] Why not use the CryptoPunksMerket (also know as V2) contract?
