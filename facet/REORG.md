Investigating why reorgs happen in proof of stake Ethereum

> I was surprised to see that there were regular reorganisations (or "reorgs")
> occurring on the Beacon Chain, so I decided to investigate to help learn more 
> about the machinations of Ethereum and Proof of Stake. 
> This article is a (slightly meandering) write up of my investigation

> On the Proof of Work Ethereum blockchain reorgs happen quite regularly. 
> You can see a list of these reorgs on the etherscan block explorer but, 
> at a quick glance, they appear to be happening at a rate of around 5 per hour.
> The rate of reorgs is a function of the block time, 
> which is why they occur more frequently on Ethereum than Bitcoin.
