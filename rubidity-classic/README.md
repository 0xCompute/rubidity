# Rubidity  (formerly known as Rubidity Classic)


Note: The ~~rubyidity-classic gem~~ is now known and published as the [rubidity gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubidity).

Q: Why?

A:  The gem formerly knows as rubidity (next) is now known and published
as rubysol and the classic / o.g. becomes the one and only rubidity
to avoid any confusion about syntax and style when contract programming in ruby.
