# Solidity Typed (formerly known as Rubidity Typed)


Note: Starting with version 0.7.4 the [rubyidity-typed gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rubidity-typed) 
is now known and published as the [solidity-typed gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/solidity-typed).

Q: Why?

A: Why not?  More serious - the idea is to stress the fact of the 100% solidity-compatibility with types and application binary interfaces (abis)
and the "zero-dependency" to support easy (re)use in many solidity-inspired (blockchain) contract programming languages incl. rubidity et al.
