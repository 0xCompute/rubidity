# Solidity Typed (formerly known as Rubidity Typed)


Note: Starting with version 0.7.4 the rubyidity-typed gem is now known and published as the solidity-typed gem.

Q: Why?

A: Why not?  More serious - the idea is to stress the fact of the 100% solidity-compabitility with types and application binary interfaces (abis)
and the "zero-depedency" to support easy (re)use in many solidity-inspired (blockchain) contract programming languages incl. rubidity et al.
